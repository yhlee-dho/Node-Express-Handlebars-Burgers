# Node-Express-Handlebars-Burgers

Deployed app: https://git.heroku.com/burgerbuilder-yhl.git

Heroku version is having errors but the application is functional locally.

This is a web application which allows the user to type in the name of the burger they would like to eat. 
The burger name is then displayed on the webpage and alongside a 'DEVOUR IT' button is generated. 
Upon clicking the button, the burger should move to the "Devoured Burgers!" list.
